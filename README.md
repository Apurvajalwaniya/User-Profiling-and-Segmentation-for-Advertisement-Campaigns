# User Profiling & Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on analyzing user data to identify meaningful customer groups based on their demographic and behavioural patterns. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, and visualization to understand user behaviour and support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview
- Preprocessed raw user data  
- Performed feature engineering and scaling  
- Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and visual understanding  
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers  
- Generated insights for each segment  

## Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and behavioural attributes such as age, income, spending score, activity level, and category preferences.  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory data analysis  
3. Feature engineering and scaling  
4. PCA for dimensionality reduction  
5. K-Means clustering  
6. Visualization of clusters  
7. Interpretation of customer segments  

## Results
The project identifies clear customer groups based on usage patterns and purchasing behaviour. These insights can be used for targeted marketing, personalization, and user engagement strategies.
